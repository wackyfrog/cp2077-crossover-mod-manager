## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added

- **Disk Space Checking** (Priority #7 - Phase 3)
  - Automatic disk space verification before mod download

  - Separate checks for temp directory and game directory
  - Helpful tips for freeing up space

### Changed

- Enhanced download logging with formatted byte sizes
- Improved error messages for insufficient disk space scenarios

### Technical

- Added `nix` crate dependency (v0.29) for statvfs filesystem statistics

- Integrated checks at two critical points:
  - Before downloading (temp directory check)
  - Before extraction (game directory check)
